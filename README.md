# 🧠 Cognivise AI

**Where Understanding Becomes Visible**

Cognivise AI is a confusion-aware learning assistant that diagnoses conceptual misunderstandings instead of simply answering questions.

Unlike traditional AI tutors, Cognivise identifies *why* a learner is confused and repairs flawed mental models using structured explanation and reinforcement.

## 🚀 Problem

Most AI learning tools:
- Provide generic explanations
- Do not detect misconception patterns
- Encourage memorization instead of understanding

Learners often:
- Repeat the same conceptual mistakes
- Misunderstand foundational logic
- Struggle with mental model clarity

---

## 💡 Solution

Cognivise AI introduces a **diagnostic-first learning system**:

1. Generates targeted diagnostic questions  
2. Analyzes learner responses  
3. Identifies confusion type  
4. Repairs the mental model  
5. Provides reinforcement exercise  
6. Tracks confusion patterns  

This ensures conceptual reconstruction, not passive consumption.
