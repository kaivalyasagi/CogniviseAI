# 🧠 Cognivise AI — System Design Document

## 1. Product Overview

Cognivise AI is a confusion-aware learning system that detects and repairs conceptual misunderstandings.

Unlike traditional AI tutors that directly answer questions, Cognivise diagnoses *why* a learner is confused and corrects flawed mental models through structured reasoning and reinforcement.

Core Idea:
Understanding is not about answers. It is about correct mental models.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Most AI learning tools:
- Provide generic explanations
- Do not detect misconception patterns
- Do not adapt explanations based on confusion type
- Do not track conceptual weaknesses

Learners often:
- Memorize solutions
- Misunderstand foundational logic
- Repeat the same mistakes

Cognivise AI solves this by introducing a diagnostic-first learning architecture.

## 3. Design Principles

1. Diagnosis before explanation
2. Structured output format
3. Mental model repair over memorization
4. Reinforcement after correction
5. Lightweight but scalable architecture

## 5. Component Breakdown

### 5.1 Frontend Layer

Responsibilities:
- Concept input interface
- Diagnostic question display
- Answer submission
- Structured AI response rendering
- Confusion dashboard display

Design Goals:
- Minimal UI complexity
- Focus on structured outputs
- Fast interaction

---

### 5.2 Backend Layer (FastAPI)

Endpoints:

POST /diagnose  
Generates 3 diagnostic questions for a given concept.

POST /analyze  
Analyzes user answers and classifies confusion type.

GET /dashboard  
Returns confusion tracking summary.

Responsibilities:
- API routing
- Prompt formatting
- Structured response parsing
- Session logging

---

### 5.3 Diagnostic Engine

Purpose:
Reveal underlying misunderstanding patterns.

Design:
- Generate reasoning-based questions
- Avoid definition-based questions
- Force mental simulation

Example (Recursion):
- What stops recursion from running infinitely?
- What happens after the first recursive call?
- Trace factorial(3) step-by-step.

---

### 5.4 Confusion Classification Engine

Purpose:
Map user answers to conceptual confusion types.

Output Structure:

Confusion Type:
Explanation:
Correct Mental Model:
Reinforcement Task:

Design Constraints:
- Deterministic format
- Clear conceptual correction
- One reinforcement activity per session

---

### 5.5 Mental Model Repair Logic

Instead of restating definitions:

Step 1: Identify flawed assumption  
Step 2: Replace with correct abstraction  
Step 3: Provide mental visualization  
Step 4: Provide applied example  

This ensures reconstruction, not memorization.

---

### 5.6 Session Tracking System

Current Implementation:
- In-memory confusion counter

Tracks:
- Concept frequency
- Confusion type frequency
- Recurring weaknesses

Future Upgrade:
- PostgreSQL integration
- User-based tracking
- Skill progression scoring

---

## 6. Data Flow

1. User selects concept.
2. Frontend sends POST /diagnose.
3. Backend calls Diagnostic Engine.
4. User submits answers.
5. Backend calls Classification Engine.
6. System stores confusion type.
7. Response returned to frontend.
8. Dashboard updates.

---

## 7. MVP Scope

Included:
- 3–5 Data Structures & Algorithms topics
- Diagnostic questioning
- Confusion classification
- Structured explanation output
- Basic dashboard tracking

Excluded:
- User authentication
- Persistent storage
- Multi-user analytics
- Instructor interface

---

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance:
- Response time under 5 seconds

Scalability:
- Modular prompt structure
- Expandable concept taxonomy

Reliability:
- Controlled output formatting
- Reduced prompt variability

Usability:
- Clear response segmentation
- Minimal cognitive overload

---

## 9. Risks and Mitigation

Risk: Over-general AI responses  
Mitigation: Structured prompt constraints

Risk: Inconsistent classification  
Mitigation: Controlled output format

Risk: Weak reinforcement quality  
Mitigation: Reinforcement template design

---

## 10. Competitive Differentiation

Cognivise AI differs from traditional tutors by:

- Detecting confusion types instead of answering directly
- Correcting mental models systematically
- Providing structured learning repair
- Tracking conceptual weaknesses

It optimizes understanding, not response speed.

---

## 11. Future Roadmap

Phase 1:
- Expand concept taxonomy
- Improve classification precision

Phase 2:
- Persistent database
- Visual heatmap charts
- User authentication

Phase 3:
- Adaptive learning pathways
- Skill scoring algorithm
- LMS integration
